                 <p>Bank of India was founded on 7th September, 1906 by a group of eminent businessmen from Mumbai. The Bank was under private ownership and control till July 1969 when it was nationalised along with 13 other banks.

                    Beginning with one office in Mumbai, with a paid-up capital of Rs.50 lakh and 50 employees, the Bank has made a rapid growth over the years and blossomed into a mighty institution with a strong national presence and sizable international operations. In business volume, the Bank occupies a premier position among the nationalized banks.
                    
                    The Bank has over 5100+ branches in India spread over all states/ union territories including specialized branches. These branches are controlled through 69 Zonal Offices and 13 FGMO Offices. There are 47 branches/ offices abroad which includes 22 own branches including IBU Gift City at Gandhinagar Gujrat, 1 representative office and 4 Subsidiaries (23 branches) and 1 joint venture.</p>

            <p>Why Use a Bank in the First Place?

                Security
                Banks protect your cash from theft and natural disasters like fires or floods. Your insurance may not cover money lost in your home, car or on your person. But banks don’t typically carry the same risk.
                Insurance
                Banking security is more than just vaults and guards. Most of your assets are federally insured up to $250,000 by the federal government if the institution fails. The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insures assets in banks and the NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) insures assets in credit unions. Federal laws also require institutions to maintain minimum levels to help them remain solvent.
                Convenience
                Banks allow you to access your money when you need it. They can also provide “one-stop shopping” for financial needs from investments to home and auto loans, along with other financial services. Convenience, along with interest rates and low fees, are major selling points for banks.</p>
